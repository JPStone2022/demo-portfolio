            <p>This portfolio website was designed and developed by Julian Stone to showcase projects, skills, and experience. Here's a bit about the technology and tools used in its creation (for this demonstration version):</p>

            <h2 class="!text-2xl">Core Technologies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python:</strong> The primary backend programming language.</li>
                <li><strong>Django:</strong> A high-level Python web framework used for structuring the application, handling requests, and rendering templates. For this Heroku demonstration, it's configured in a "database-less" manner, with content managed via static Python data structures.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="!text-2xl">Frontend</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> For structuring the content.</li>
                <li><strong>Tailwind CSS:</strong> A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the website and ensuring a responsive design. It allows for rapid UI development directly in the markup.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Used for interactive elements like the dark mode theme toggle.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> The "Inter" font family is used for typography.</li>
                <li><strong>Heroicons & SVG:</strong> For icons used throughout the site.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 class="!text-2xl">Development & Deployment (for this Demo)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visual Studio Code:</strong> Primary code editor.</li>
                <li><strong>Git & GitHub:</strong> For version control and code hosting.</li>
                <li><strong>Heroku:</strong> This demonstration version is configured for deployment on Heroku, a cloud platform as a service (PaaS).</li>
                <li><strong>Gunicorn:</strong> A Python WSGI HTTP server for UNIX, used to serve the Django application on Heroku.</li>
                <li><strong>WhiteNoise:</strong> For serving static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) efficiently in production with Django.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="!text-2xl">Design Principles</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clean and Modern Aesthetic:</strong> Aiming for a professional and visually appealing presentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensuring the site looks and works well on all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).</li>
                <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Focused on clear navigation and easy access to information.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Striving to make the website accessible to as many people as possible by following WCAG guidelines where feasible.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This site is a continuous work in progress, and I plan to update it with new projects and features over time. The actual live portfolio (if hosted elsewhere like Render) might utilize a full database backend for more dynamic content management.</p>
